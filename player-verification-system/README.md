```bash
cd ../scripts
python create_admin.py --interactive
```

Follow the prompts to create your first admin account.

**Alternatively, use command-line mode:**
```bash
python create_admin.py --username admin --email admin@school.edu --role super_admin
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### For Players

#### Step 1: Registration
1. Run the registration client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   python registration_gui.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Provide consent for data collection
   - Enter your name and student ID
   - Capture 5 facial photos from different angles
   - Get your device fingerprint
   - Complete registration

3. Save your Player ID (automatically saved to `player_credentials.txt`)

#### Step 2: Tournament Day Verification
1. Launch the verification client:
   ```bash
   python player_client.py
   ```

2. Enter your Player ID when prompted

3. Click "Start Verification"

4. Keep the application running during your entire tournament session

5. The system will:
   - Verify your face every 30-60 seconds
   - Display verification status (VERIFIED/FAILED)
   - Show your webcam feed with face detection
   - Log all verification attempts

### For Administrators

#### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
cd server
python app.py
```

The server will start at: http://localhost:5000

#### Step 2: Access Admin Dashboard
1. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5000/admin/login

2. Login with your admin credentials

3. You will see:
   - Real-time verification statistics
   - Recent verification logs
   - List of registered players
   - Live updates via WebSocket

#### Step 3: Monitor Tournament
- View real-time verification status for all active players
- Check verification history and confidence scores
- Review captured images for flagged incidents
- Export reports for post-tournament analysis

## 🔧 Configuration

### Server Configuration
Edit `server/app.py` to configure:

```python
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key-change-in-production'
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(hours=8)
```

### Face Recognition Tolerance
Adjust recognition strictness in `server/verification.py`:

```python
face_verifier = FaceVerification(tolerance=0.6)  # Lower = more strict
```

### Verification Interval
Change check frequency in `client/player_client.py`:

```python
self.verification_interval = 30  # seconds between checks
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test 1: Camera Access
```bash
cd server
python verification.py
```

### Test 2: Device Fingerprinting
```bash
cd server/utils
python device_fingerprint.py
```

### Test 3: Face Recognition
1. Run registration with test data
2. Run verification client
3. Verify face is detected and matched

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Camera not detected
**Solution**: 
- Check camera permissions
- Try different camera index in OpenCV (0, 1, 2)
- Ensure no other application is using the camera

### Issue: Face recognition fails
**Solution**:
- Ensure adequate lighting
- Position face clearly in camera view
- Register with multiple angles during setup
- Adjust tolerance threshold

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution**:
```bash
cd database
rm verification_system.db  # Delete old database
cd ../server
python models.py  # Reinitialize
```

### Issue: Module not found
**Solution**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### Issue: face_recognition installation fails
**Solution**:
- Install cmake first
- Ensure Python development headers are installed
- Try: `pip install dlib` separately first
